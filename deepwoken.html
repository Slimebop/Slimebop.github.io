			Hades, Released in late 2018, is a rogue-like game based around the greek god Zagreus. Throughout the game, you interact with various greek gods. Zagreus may "Romance" (ie: date them) both a male (Patroclus) and a female (Megaera).  Zagreus does not specifically state that he is bisexual, but through being able to have a relationship with both a male character and a female character it can be stated that he is Bisexual. Not only does he date both am ale and a female, but Zagreus is able to romance both of them at once without any conflict, infact the only conflict that comes out of this is Megaera saying a witty comment if you start dating Patroclus before Megaera.

			You can also hit on Achilles, although he does reject you. That is beacuse there is also the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus, which were seperated in the underworld (where the game takes place). Although this is true, into the late-game stage of Hades, you can reunite the two lovers. Again, although not clearly stated that this is a romantic relationship in the game, the characters have a relationship between eachother, making it a Queer relationship at least.

				<li id="good">Confirmed Queer Relationship(s)</li>
				<li id="good">LGBTQ+ Main Character</li>
				<li id="good">Multiple LGBTQ+ representations</li>
				<li id="evil">Optional Side-Choices for the representation (Not Commiting to the idea of having a queer relationship in the game)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Overall I think that Hades should be celebrated for their Queer characters by the LGBTQ+ Community. I think this beacuse the representation in the game is positive and doesnt play into too many tropes (Its also based upon the stories of the greek gods)</p>
